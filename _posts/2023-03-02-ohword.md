Inspired by Wordle, I decided to create my own daily game. I started with the code of a game I had developed before to play with just my family, and I looked into changing up the rules.

I added:
- point incentives for writing longer words
- new values for each letter
- a puzzle generation system instead of a randomized set of letters

I called it: OhWord!?. My family and friends liked it, so I kept working on it.

I added
- global leaderboards
- superlatives (called honors)
- share buttons with emoji text (much like Wordle)
- a random mode to play more than just the daily

This was the most intense I've ever focused on a side project, I had Cypress and Jest tests, I had analytics set up with event nomenclature. I added a Redis database and admin page.
