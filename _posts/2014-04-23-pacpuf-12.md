By my senior year I was eager to place first in state. I created my most ambitious website thus far. It was another one-page click-to-scroll site, but this time I teamed up with a friend to help create the graphics.

The home page was a full screen video of the flag waving in black and white. It helped set the tone and was very ominous looking.

Each slide was a full screen page of information.

Each slide had a unique shattered, censored, and glitchy background.

This website made it to states but did not place. I never was best in state.
