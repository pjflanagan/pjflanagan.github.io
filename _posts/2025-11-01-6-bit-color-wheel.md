The Garmin (at least my Garmin) is only capable of displaying 6-bit colors.

I found a website that lists and displays [a 6-bit color palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/6-bit-rgb), but it's hard to see how those colors relate and compare to one another in a grid.

Color is 3 dimensional, so I put them into a cube.

Hovering over a color reveals that layer of colors.
