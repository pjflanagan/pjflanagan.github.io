During the pandemic I felt compelled to [rebuild a site](/blog/2015/colors-of-pi) I worked on many years ago. Before, this website was a large html file generated by python. 

This time I had the webpage load the file, making it able to display other irrational numbers. Rather than a hover effect, I displayed the numbers on the color. This way you can read pi in its "entirety." 

To be honest, I'm not sure if this is much of an improvement outside of that. The colors show up one at a time, making the webpage half blank when zoomed out.
