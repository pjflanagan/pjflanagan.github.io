A coworker asked me to help volunteer at a Hackathon with students at Columbia. The TOM program pairs engineers and individuals with special needs to help create tools to assist them. We were paired with a woman named Michelle who likes to do calligraphy but has limited motor functions. She is very capable of controlling a computer, so we devised a 3D-printer-style robot that can make brush stroked.

## UI

As a web developer, I was in charge of the UI. While I have plenty of experience making web apps and some Arduino projects under my belt, I have never paired the two. Making a web UI capable of controlling a robot was very exciting.

The first problem was figuring out how to interface the two. In order to do that, we had to find the open socket on the Arduino.

The interface featured a canvas that previewed the strokes, a series of moves that could be edited to make the stroke, and saved commands with known strokes and actions like dipping the brush in more ink.

After a whole weekend at the Hackathon, I got the UI to a much more comprehensive place. We would save strokes as `.stroke` files. The UI displayed the angle of the brush, with a pressure indicator. The current and next position we're described on screen. And the buttons to move the brush could easily be pressed with eye-tracking software.

## Build

My team members with robotics experience spearheaded the construction of the robot. The robot would angle, lift, and zig-zag the brush across the x-axis. To make vertical stroked, the robot would slide the paper itself up and down.
