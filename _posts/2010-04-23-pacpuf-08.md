Middle school computer apps class was where my interest for the web started. In 7th grade we had to start and maintain a blog. This was before many of us had Facebook accounts, so all of our after school communication was sharing links on AIM and forwarding emails. I was thrilled whenever I posted things that got shares and likes.

In 8th grade, I found my love for web design. We had to create a simple HTML page in DreamWeaver about an endangered species. I had a blast making it. With HTML I could control so much more of the page than I could on the blog. My teacher noticed my interest and encouraged me to submit a website for the Pennsylvania State Computer Fair.

That year every 8th grade student had to do a large project about something that happened in the 21st century. I chose Fractal Geometry.

Using the basic header, footer, two sidebars, and central content template DreamWeaver starts out with, I created a simple webpage. It was easy to put content on this site from my school project.

I added all the bells and whistles of the 2000s, fun things like cursor animations and page transitions.

The website won second place at states.
