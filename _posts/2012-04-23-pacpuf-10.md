In 10th grade I returned to the computer fair with a website about atomic theory. In class we learned about Flash animations, so I knew I had to incorporate Flash in this year's project.

I designed a one-page click-to-scroll website where informational widgets would slide out a bottom portal and through a top portal. I thought it looked really cool.

Of course, Flash no longer works by default on most browsers.

Like last year, this website did not make it to states.
