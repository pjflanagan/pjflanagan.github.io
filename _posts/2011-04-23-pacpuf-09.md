In freshman year I re-entered the Pennsylvania State Computer Fair. In English class that year I did a project about Franz Kafka so I used that for my submission.

I wanted to go for a realistic look, with scanned papers, journals and pens on a desk.

The high school level competition was fierce and I did not make it to states.
