At the end of Freshman year, I ran for Webmaster of the running club. I won, as I was unopposed.

I quickly set out to try and revamp the website from its previous simple blog-looking pages.

I used Bootstrap and the existing php framework they had setup and created a new site, complete with a "loading" animation, carousel, fancy fonts, scroll effects and more.

Webmasters since have added pages for listing merchandise, displaying routes, and news updates.
