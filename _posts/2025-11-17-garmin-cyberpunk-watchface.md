This year I bought a Garmin to help me train for a half marathon (and hopefully a full marathon in the future).
I have a love/hate relationship with smart watches. I think that having notifications on my wrist is pretty annoying.
I wouldn't want the watch to be more powerful than this (like an Apple Watch). I typically use a very minimal watch face.

At the same time, I think data can be pretty. Most watch faces that show a lot of data are overloaded with labels and icons.
The Cyberpunk aesthetic makes data overload fun. So that's what I made.

## Garmin ConnectIQ Store Description

Hey choom, get a load of this preem watch face. Your cyberware'll be lookin' nova with this HUD straight from the streets of Night City.

Detes:

- Flatline: check your health bar and don't get zeroed, featuring daily goal tracking, body battery, and heart rate with hr zone.
- Chippin' in: keep your fixer happy and see your latest activity and training status in the mission section.
- Riders on the Storm: see the weather for the day with this custom HUD, featuring UV index, precip chance, humidity, and the high/low.
- Who's Ready for Tomorrow: a 24 hour bezel shows the time of day and a second hand. Also shown are the time, date, and day of week.

Enjoy the new chrome Rockerboy, this netrunner's gotta delta.

## Features

- Yellow indicates actionable information (daily goal progress, current activity, weather alerts)
- The second hand and hour indicator start from the bottom (midnight) to reflect the sun's position (although the watch does maintain clockwise movement rather than east-west movement)

Weather
- weather condition (blue or yellow)
- uv index (blue or yellow)
- precipitation chance (blue or yellow)
- humidity %
- current temp
- high / low temp
- wind speed and direction

Time
- time of day (am/pm or 24 hours)
- day of week (starting Sunday or Monday)

- body battery, with current and max
- current heart rate zone

Activity

## Plans

This watch has had plenty of feedback online, so I want to keep working on it. But a lot of the work can be tedious. Looking forward, I will keep the current version online as a free tier. When I get around to making changes, like:
- support for more watches
- moon phase
- more settings
- battery and bluetooth indicator (which I personally dislike)
- more weather icons
- use the actual Cyberpunk font
I'll make that new version a paid version.
