Following two years with failures to make states, I was determined to make it back this year.

The one-page click-to-scroll became a favorite of mine. I was inspired by other parallax sites that had become popular at the time (specifically one about a pair of Saucony shoes). I came up with the idea of following an apple downward while the rest of the webpage scrolled up around it.

Much to my delight, the website made it to states and placed second at the state competition.
