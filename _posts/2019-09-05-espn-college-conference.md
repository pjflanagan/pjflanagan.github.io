It's a tale as old as time that the SEC is the best at College Football. Or are they so I (along with everyone in the BIG10) asked?

I added a conference column to the football rankings to make this data point more obvious.

The BIG10 has regrouped, prompting ESPN to add this feature by default, making this Chrome extension useless and out of date.
