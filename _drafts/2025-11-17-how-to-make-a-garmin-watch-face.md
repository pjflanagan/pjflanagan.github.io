Making a Garmin Watch Face can be very rewarding because you get to wear something you programmed around on your wrist. In that sense it's much closer to the physical world than building a website.

In this tutorial I'm going to explain (or link to other tutorials that explain), everything you need to know to set up a Garmin Watch Face.

## Setup

### Monkey C Setup

### Repository Guide

### Running the App

### Helpful Tools and Guides

#### Image Resize Tool

#### Device Sizes

#### Colors

#### Fonts

Fonts for your watch face need to be explicitly defined in Bitmap format. They cannot be resized live.

## Live

### Releasing

### Error Monitoring
