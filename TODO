## Data
A: source the data from pjflanagan.me
Use a Netlify function or just make a static page of app data
+ this will keep my website compling nicley
- there will be more data here

B: use this as the source of the data for my portfolio
+ This will probably contain more data that my personal site
- this will make my personal site not compile properly and instead rely on a fetch to here

C: keep both separate
+ less functionality to worry about
+ don't have to make a decision
- there will be duplicate data
